# Teamwork contract of group 23 in DSCI 532

In this contract, we will state the rules that should be followed by all the team members. The teamwork contract aims to let everyone in the team feel supported and succeed at the end of this project. Team members are expected to follow this contract. 


Here are the specific contents of our team contract:

**Communication**

- The communication tools are slack and Github issues. We will use slack to notify meeting times, pull requests and some other basic communications. The GitHub issue is used for decision making and essential challenging problems that we need to solve. 

**Meetings**

- Team members need to meet on Tuesday during our lab session (from 2 PM to 4 PM). During this meeting, responsibilities need to be assigned.

- The second meeting of the week will be held on Zoom on Friday to figure out what we have done through the whole project. 

- If we still have problems that we need to solve, we can set up another Saturday meeting. 

**Responsibilities**

- Each team member must look through all instructions on each milestone before meeting in the lab session. During the lab session, each team member will be assigned to a section or sections on each milestone. Then for the rest of the week, members can work on their sections so that team members can merge everything on the group Github repo before the second meeting.


**Deadlines**

- To make the time much more flexible, the deadline for finishing each milestone is on Friday night. Team members are expected to work through the week during each milestone.


**Attribution**

- This team contract is adapted from the [UBC-MDS DSCI_532_Group_113_Overdose Team Contract](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_532_Group_113_Overdose/blob/master/TEAM_CONTRACT.md).

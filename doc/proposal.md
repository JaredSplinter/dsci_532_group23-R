# Proposal of building a dashboard about world energy 
- author: DSCI 532 group 23

### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Our role: International Energy Agency

Target audience: World leaders and the public

Energy use and consumption are related to health and the environment.
Excessive energy consumption will cause air pollution, climate change,
destruction of ecosystems, and human health damage. In response to this
challenge, we propose building a data visualization dashboard that
allows world leaders and the public to visually discover a
world energy dataset. We appeal to decision makers and the public to reduce energy
consumption and to invest in alternative renewable energy sources. Our dashboard will show a world map heatmap to show energy use by country and  allows the colour to change by the energy type selected. Our dashboard
will also offer one or two other secondary charts that change over time.

### Section 2: Description of the data

We will visualize a tidy world energy dataset of 56706 observations. This
dataset initially comes from an untidy version of the world energy
dataset. After cleaning the data, we will have four columns, which are
`year`, energy type (`energy_type`), country code (`country_code`), and
energy consumption (`energy`). The year column contains different types of
energy that were used by time from 1980 to 2018. The energy type
(`energy_type`) column contains different kinds of energy such as coal,
natural gas, petroleum and other liquids etc. The country code (`country_code`)
column contains different countries code names. The energy consumption
(`energy`) column contains the consumption amounts of different types of
energy. Moreover, units (quad Btu) for all energy consumption are the
same.


### Section 3: Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

World leaders, decision makers and the public will be able to use this app to see how much each country uses energy in relation to other countries. In addition, they will be able to see how much of this energy comes from different energy sources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear, petroleum and renewable energy.

Leaders of a country may want to understand the country's energy consumption and address any potential needs, look for ways to make the country more efficient or compare with other countries. To do this, the International Energy Agency creates a dashboard from a dataset to show how each country consumes energy. A world leader or country decision maker logs on the the "World Energy Consumption Map" and finds their country. In their investigation they may notice a good portion of the country's energy comes from coal. They also notice some of the more advanced countries have started to transition to different energy sources such as nuclear power or renewable energy. The decision maker then decides to follow suit and invests in new energy sources that may be more efficient, produce more energy to provide for more people and save more money. With addition of including time, leaders may be able to see the trajectory their country is going with their energy consumption and look to take measures to reduce the amount of energy consumed.

Members of the public or environmental activists may want to understand this information themselves. Any person that has an interest may log on to the app and find how much energy the world consumes and how it has changed over time. Let's say someone logs on and notices that their country has in recent years been consuming more coal, an energy source harmful to the environment. With the information provided in the dashboard, a person can petition their government to introduce change, gather support from others and push the government to invest in more sustainable energy practices. A person after seeing the information from the dashboard may decided to switch from a gas powered car to an electric powered car. Support for the app and the information provided could put some pressure on countries to become more sustainable and to join the International Energy Agency as a member.
